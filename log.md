# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 8, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Started the Free Code Camp image search project.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with chosing an image search API, but i finaly received some help on the FCC Gitter channel and the Imgur API seems to be a good choice.

**Link(s) to work**: [Image Search Microservice](https://github.com/Ilyes-Hammadi/image_search)
